### Now we finish our big battle with Salvatore, on [#]fistfulofmithril!
### Lex yells a challenge at his old foe, waits to achieve line of sight, and shoots the necroromancer...
### 
### ...who shrugs it off.
### 
### Belle casts Healing Word on herself, but still has less then half her HP.
### 
### Salvatore is powerful and is doing the ouchies to the party.
### 
### -------
### 
### This campaign is now The Campaign of Too Many Rogues. We have FOUR. FOUR ROGUES. No wizards. lol
### 
### -------
### 
### Knell: "Let's not make killing this person a habit. Two times is plenty."
### 
### Belle: "Third time's the charm!"
### 
### Kyrial: "Let's make the second time the charm!"
### 
### -------
### 
### Many exciting shots and stabs and slashes later, Kyrial finishes Salvatore with her crossbow, does a forward roll out of cover, raises her crossbow, and shoots him through the neck, knocking him off his feet and into the pillar. Salvatore is NO MORE.
### 
### -------
### 
### Lex steps on his head for good measure, and yells at him to STAY DEAD THIS TIME. We burn him and separate his ashes far and wide.
### 
### -------
### 
### Kyrial finds much of her family's belongings in the treasury at the entrance to the keep that is the beginning of the mine. Belle stands next to Kyrial and quietly sings a memorial song for Kyrial's people as Kyrial weeps quietly. 
### 
### -------
### 
### Jane has found her strength, and taken pride in helping people. She's become fond of these people, and she thinks she might stay around. Knell has more than repaid her lifedebt, but is sticking around for now. Splendid has seen his oldest enemy dead twice now...
### 
### -------
### 
### ...and is more than ready to move forward with his life, now that he's learning magic. Gordon has been a solid friend and companion throughout, and through time spent with Belle and Malio, has learned Goblin along with Belle.
### 
### -------
### 
### Malio has become fast friends with Gordon and Belle, and told them so. Lex has also seen the traitor of his people slain (twice), and is really ready to do something (anything) else.
### 
### -------
### 
### Kyrial stands, looks at the party, and solemnly says the following, having dried her tears and regained her composure:
### 
### "And now at last, the real work can begin."
### 
###  [#]fistfulofmithril will return. This is Belledora Ironmaul, dwarven battle bard & archivist, signing off until then.
