### It's time for another installment of [#]fistfulofmithril !
### 
### -------
### 
### Last time on [#]fistfulofmithril, we left our heroes in a dwarven mine, and they have encountered a mother owlbear and her two cubs. WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG.
### 
### -------
### 
### The owlbear and her cubs are currently distracted by the rotting horsemeat chunk that Belle used Mage Hand to place near them.
### 
### -------
### 
### Welp, Kyrial is poisoned.... City girls. Whatcha gonna do.
### 
### -------
### 
### Aaaand we probably have to kill the owlbears. :( Because otherwise we can't continue our mission. We're gonna try to see if we can box them in, though.
### 
### -------
### 
### Sorry, the archivist today is not at her best, and so far it's most combat against a pesky mother owlbear.
### 
### -------
### 
### The owlbears have fucked off into the mine complex, so we're moving on. 
### 
### -------
### 
### The riddle from last session: "A riddle:
### 
### "She clamors, shod in boots of iron, and on paths of iron only does she tread. She cares nothing for the blazing sun before her, nor for the heat of the road 'neath her feet, for she knows she never need fear their fire. And so thus continue her resounding footsteps. Who is She?"
### 
### A hammer.
### 
### -------
### 
### "The best kind of bomb, the kind that blew up before I got there..." (We found a spot in the mine that looks like the remains of an arcane trap...)
### 
### -------
### 
### The mine was created by 5 major clans, including the Ironmaul clan. It was a tenuous arrangement at best, and only those 5 had the right resources to take this on.
### 
### -------
### 
### The Forgebright clan were the expert arcane practitioners, with very powerful wizards. The Kindlebreath clan were the traditional bards of the Northern holds.
### 
### -------
### 
### Flamelance were the warrior heavies, the shocktroopers, Ironmaul were the refiners and artificers, the Shapesteel clan were the smiths. 
### 
### -------
### 
### Uhhhh we're fighting a black pudding.
### 
### I mean a pseudopod.
### 
### Ew.
### 
### -------
### 
### Kyrial:
### "He is the Pudding king
### Made of acid and gelatine"
### (TTTO "Dancing Queen")
### 
### Belle hit the pudding for 4, it splashed her for 6. Rude.
### 
### -------
### 
### "I'm gonna make evil mochi out of this thing!"
### 
### -------
### 
### We defeated the pudding! 
### Belle found an axe in the hand of a dwarven deity statue!
### Knell left a trinket at the statue! 
### We have very different reactions! <3
### 
### Thus ends this installment of [#]fistfulofmithril !
