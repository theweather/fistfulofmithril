### It's time again for [#]FistfulOfMithril !
### 
### We're currently trying to flee from a bunch of hobgoblins!
### 
### The DM is making us do skill challenges, a la this video:
### 
### [https://youtu.be/GvOeqDpkBm8] (https://youtu.be/GvOeqDpkBm8)
### 
### -------
### 
### Neither Belle nor Lex are good at clearing the path of things that will make noise. The druid effectively hid us from the hobgoblins long enough that we were able to break camp. Knell, however, is having much more success in this moving silently endeavor.
### 
### -------
### 
### Jane, our cleric, is attempting to use her animal handling to make us more stealthy, but........
### 
### The virtual dice do not love us today, much, thus far.
### 
### -------
### 
### Malio, Belle's goblin friend, has a brilliant idea to hide in these tall smelly bushes, and he rolls REALLY WELL!
### 
### We hide the party, including the horse, in the smellybushes.
### 
### We have again barely eluded the hobgoblins.
### 
### -------
### 
### We have a sort of dubious icy bridge, and Belle suggests Gordon use some salt to de-ice it.
### He succeeds!
### 
### -------
### 
### Many of us have made it across the bridge just fine thus far...
### 
### -------
### 
### Suddenly four hobgoblins and a hobgoblin captain appear, and Belle tries to use Message to deceive the captain into not pursuing them.
### 
### She got a 14, sooo...
### 
### -------
### 
### Knell successfully shot the captain!
### 
### -------
### 
### Lex shoots the Hobgoblin captain REAL GOOD.
### Belle casts Shatter and kills two of the hobgoblins just by operatically shrieking "I AM SO TIRED OF HOBGOBLINS!"
### 
### -------
### 
### Splendid casts Firebolt and very much hurts the hobgoblin that's on him.
### 
### -------
### 
### Splendid's made it across the bridge, and Knell saved him from slipping on the ice off the bridge!
### 
### Gordon takes out the bridge.
### 
### Jane kills last hobgoblin lackey w/ Guiding Bolt.
### 
### Unfortunately, Hobgoblin captain ran. Lex MAYBE can shoot him anyway. We'll see.
### 
### -------
### 
### Lex is not able to shoot him, and he gets away. Sad trombone.
### 
### -------
### 
### The watches are assigned.
### 1st: Knell and Gordon
### 2nd: Kyrial and Splendid
### 3rd: Belle and Jane
### 
### Jane found us an EXCELLENT place to camp.
### 
### -------
### 
### The night passes uneventfully and we get a long rest.
### 
### Belle teaches Malio dwarven nursery rhymes. riddles, and teaching stories/songs.
### 
### -------
### 
### A riddle:
### 
### "She clamors, shod in boots of iron, and on paths of iron only does she tread. She cares nothing for the blazing sun before her, nor for the heat of the road 'neath her feet, ..."
### 
### -------
### 
### "...for she knows she never need fear their fire. And so thus continue her resounding footsteps. Who is She?"
### 
### -------
### 
### Gordon makes friends with Malio by finding out what kinds of foods he actually likes. It is very good.
### 
### Belle continues to teach Malio language, more Common than Dwarven, but definitely Dwarven.
### 
### -------
### 
### They've gone into the mine beginnings, and I sure forgot to type stuff. SO. continuing.
### 
### There is a baby owlbear. Much to Belle's chagrin, it is NOT friendly, despite being adorable.
### 
### -------
### 
### The adventure concluded for the day with a second baby owlbear, and the mama, suddenly appearing.
### 
### Belle loves animals.
### Belle has very little experience with animals.
### This will definitely go well.
### 
### TUNE IN NEXT TIME FOR HIJINKS AND POSSIBLE OWLBEAR ATTACKS.
