### Now for more [#]fistfulofmithril!
### 
### "Eenie, meenie, miney, no statue!"
### 
### -------
### 
### Five great clans, each brought their gifts to this place. Now, empty it stands. To breathe life back into its halls; to bring fire back to its forges, name the gifts of each in turn. But woe to the 1 who names the wrong gift, for death awaits the fool who tries.
### 
### -------
### 
### Struck from the rock and the metal she wrought, she breathes life into ruined blade. By hosts and bandits alike she is greeted with open palms, though none dare embrace her. Who is she? (pike and tablet) Previous one is just a tablet.
### 
### -------
### 
### She clamors, shod in boots of iron, and on paths of iron only does she tread. She cares nothing for the blazing sun before her, nor for the heat of the road 'neath her feet, for she knows she never need fear their fire.
### 
### -------
### 
### And so continues the resounding tremors of her footsteps. Who is she?
### 
### A hammer! This is the Ironmaul one!
### 
### -------
### 
### Who is he that is battered, but never bowed? Who takes wave upon wave of blades and hammers against his crown, and yet is never moved? Who, though the heat of the sun beats on his brow, never breaks sweat? 
### 
### -------
### 
### With arms widespread, he blows forth a breathless breeze. With every breeze he blows, his lover's heart doth pulse with heat. Who is he?
### 
### The bellows.
### 
### -------
### 
### The first she breathes, and she is the sun of the second and third.
### She is the lover of the fourth. Who is she?
### 
### The fire.
### 
### -------
### 
### We figured out the riddle order!
### 
### Ore
### Hammer
### Anvil
### Bellows
### Heat
### 
### -------
### 
### Then we pieced together a puzzle from pieces we got from the statues with riddles!
### 
### We've crossed the scary bridge to get to the door opened by the puzzle...
### 
### ...aaaaaand we're rolling initiative.
### 
### -------
### 
### Lex: DID HE HAVE SPELLS LAST TIME?
### 
### Knell: Well, dying does change a person...
### 
### -------
### 
### "YOU ARE BAD AND SHOULD FEEL BAD"
### 
### Belle hits a zombie for 2 points. It feels bad about itself.
### 
### -------
### 
### Some of the party is taking heavy damage.
### 
### Hecking Salvatore.
### 
### -------
### 
### Belle needs more spell slots.
### 
### -------
### 
### Moral: do not ask someone else to load your musket. They might roll a 1.
### 
### -------
### 
### "If you're undead and you know it clap your hands (if you have 'em)" - Belle's inspiration to Knell
### 
### -------
### 
### Aaaand now we have skeletons coalescing behind us. THIS IS FINE.
### 
### Also, cast iron frying pan vs zombie flesh is a very particular sound, and Sunnie (Knell's player) does not envy the foley artist.
### 
### -------
### 
### Jane has blessed Kyrial, Lex, and Belle. [#]blessed
### 
### -------
### 
### Belle has made bonemeal out of one of the skeletons.
### 
### -------
### 
### And then a skeleton stabbed her. Belle has 4 HP left. Splendid killed that skeleton. Belle will be healing herself asap.
### 
### -------
### 
### We killed all the zombies, and now just Salvatore is left for next time!
