## NOTES:
### After this session, it was pointed out by Kyrial's player Rob that perhaps our party needs to invest in a dice spa to help our dice relax after bad rolls.
### Rob also helpfully documented this session, which you can find [here] (https://www.autographedcat.com/2019/11/26/a-fistful-of-mithril-the-journey-begins/).
