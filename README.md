## NOTES:
###
### Nearly all of the tweets originally had our hashtag, [#]fistfulofmithril, and some other hashtags. That was for organizational purposes, so for most tweets that have been archived here, the hashtags will have been removed unless they are funnier left in or are in the first or last tweet of the thread.
