### It's once again time for [#]FistfulOfMithril! I'm the party archivist and dwarven battle bard, Belledora Ironmaul!
### 
### -------
### 
### Last time on [#]FistfulOfMithril, we had many harrowing adventures, including reclaiming the old dwarven Mithril mine using TEAMWORK! Kyrial's family treasure was also found and retrieved. We'll meet up with Malio later to help liberate his people from the hobgoblin threat.
### 
### -------
### 
### The human village welcomed us as heroes, and we rested, relaxed, and planned. We also hosted a wedding. 
### 
### Splendid witnessed a break-in to the old mayor's house, the scope of which we currently do not fully understand.
### 
### And now, our continued [#]FistfulOfMithril adventures.
### 
### -------
### 
### Halia, the defacto mayor of the town, will help coordinate people and the money to rebuild Kyrial's family home. Each of us get the equivalent of 1000 gold pieces for our work. Jane finds two diamonds (important for resurrecting dead party members).
### 
### -------
### 
### She also found what is probably a magical pearl in a gold setting as a necklace. It shimmers and tingles. Vivian recognizes it as a Pearl of Power.
### 
### -------
### 
### Kyrial finds a magic torque. We don't know more about it right now. 
### 
### -------
### 
### She gives it to Gordon, and it will allow him to use his action surge more than once per long rest!
### 
### -------
### 
### Halia takes a letter from Kyrial and a letter from Belle to Delago, the nearest larger town.
### 
### -------
### 
### Linnea, the local arms/armorer, is staying in the village to train people up.
### 
### -------
### 
### Kyrial brings Vivian up to speed on our alliance with Malio, and Vivian recalls that the goblins used to work in the dwarven mines, and that human/goblin alliances used to be more common.
### 
### -------
### 
### The party travels to Argento to find Malio again. Belle is NOT HUMMING. Or singing. 
### 
### Gordon is unsure if Belle if feeling alright...
### 
### -------
### 
### WELL there's manticores! Luckily, Knell and Kyrial spotted them VERY EARLY and we get a surprise attack round!
### 
### -------
### 
### You see, the manticores are working with the lich king dude's side of things, so they are not friend material.
### 
### -------
### 
### "somewherrrre near to a crossbow
### manticorrrrrre
### there's a bolt that's gone flying
### restraining's what it's forrrrrr"
### 
### Knell's got an awesome crossbow that shoots restraining bolts!
### 
### -------
### 
### "MURDERDANCE!"
### "That's not safe..."
### 
### -------
### 
### We have killed the first manticore. The other is HURTIN'.
### 
### -------
### 
### WELL Belle's got the Manticore's attention.
### 
### Manticore: "Dwarf flesh. My favorite. Succulent. Delicious."
### 
### Belle: *snarls* "Manticore blood. Invigorating!"
### 
### -------
### 
### Many hits later, the second Manticore (the female) is Not Doing Well (tm).
### 
### -------
### 
### The Manticore tries to bite, claw, claw Belle, and only catches her with the last claw swipe. Belle yells "MANTICORE STEAKS NEED TO BE TENDERIZED BEFORE YOU EAT THEM" and SMACKS the manticore with her hammer!
### 
### -------
### 
### Other truly excellent attacks: Knell's crossbow, Splendid's Firebolt. Excellent idea that didn't land, unfortunately, Vivian's cold cantrip followed by more damage to something that's been cold damaged!
### 
### -------
### 
### Gordon obliterates the manticore's head with his pan.
### Gordon: "We'll eating well tonight!"
### Belle: "Manticores are food, not friends!"
### 
### -------
### 
### Gordon harvests 12 manticore spines (barbs, not back bones), and enough meat for dinner tonight! 
### 
### Knell harvests 2 manticore spines (barbs, not backbones)!
### 
### Take THAT, manticores!
### 
### -------
### 
### Splendid and Kyrial keep 6 spines (they can be used as projecticles), and Knell keeps 2.
### 
### -------
### 
### It's late enough that we're making camp under the nearby trees, and we're disposing of the manticore bodies.
### 
### -------
### 
### And that's where we'll leave it for today! This is Belledora Ironmaul, Battle Bard and Archivist, signing off until next time!
