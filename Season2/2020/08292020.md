### It's time once again for [#]FistfulOfMithril! I'm Belledora Ironmaul, your Battle Bard and Party Archivist!
### 
### -------
### 
### (The Bard's computer is having. Challenges.)
### 
### -------
### 
### We've returned to a village, but there's a bunch of soldiery activity now, and we're trying to suss out what's going on.
### 
### -------
### 
### The people are building walls and fortifying the town. It's the end of the day. We go to an inn, and the tired people are drinking ale and cider. We go in, and people give up a table for us. Our rep is spreading.
### 
### -------
### 
### The innkeeper very kindly brings us all drinks and food on the house, and asks Belle to grace the inn with music. She gladly agrees, having been just about to offer on her own.
### 
### -------
### 
### Tomme Scolio is our kind innkeeper.
### 
### Splendid asks if they've seen wyvern patrols. They have seen them, but mostly they've left them alone.
### 
### -------
### 
### Unfortunately, one of the hobgoblin patrols got away after we encountered them.
### 
### -------
### 
### We tell them about how Malio's people used to live in the forest before the blight came. 
### 
### Belle has written a song about it and will play it in her set tonight.
### 
### -------
### 
### She slips in the song about goblins in among common songs, dance songs, ballads, etc. Encore is an old dwarven ballad about the King Under the Mountain and his vast machine.
### 
### -------
### 
### A young man and a young woman come up to Kyrial and ask her to be their marriage officiant, but Kyrial is unsure whether she currently has the legal standing. FORTUNATELY we have a cleric, who is ordained. Gordon volunteers to cook, Belle volunteers to play.
### 
### -------
### 
### Vivian, Marquis Rodrigo's court magician, is introduced to the group by Hallea.
### 
### Suddenly, we notice that Knell is nowhere to be found. We eventually find a stablehand that tells us she bought one of his horses a few hours ago and tore out of town.
### 
### -------
### 
### We decide to wait until morning to see if we hear from Knell.
### 
### -------
### 
### In the morning after a good night's sleep, we awaken to the sounds of the inn getting ready for the day. The day is now before us.
### 
### -------
### 
### Splendid has climbed to a tall place to find a lookout spot. Folks are helping Jane prepare the space for the wedding.
### 
### -------
### 
### Knell is back! She has captured a hobgoblin who we shall be interrogating with ZONE OF TRUTH at some point.
### 
### -------
### 
### We have put on a good wedding for the young couple.
### 
### -------
### 
### Dario (sp?) the captain of the guard, is in charge of setting the guard on the town. Kyrial is more than happy to leave that to him.
### 
### -------
### 
### (The couple is a farmer and an apprentice weaver.) As a thank you, she gives Kyrial and Jane some wool cloth she made as a thank you.)
### 
### -------
### 
### Vivian and Splendid are discussing magic use, and seem to have some common magical origins.
### 
### -------
### 
### Margrave of Delago is the guy Vivian's the court magician for. Any earlier titles given to him were an error on the part of the archivist.
### 
### -------
### 
### There is a scraping sound behind a building, that Splendid hears. Splendid investigates...there a tall black clad hooded figure with what looks like a large beak and big glowing eyes picking the lock. Figure goes into the house, and closes the door behind them. 
### 
### -------
### 
### Splendid is looking through the window near the door. The figure is searching the room, and starts rifling through a desk.
### 
### -------
### 
### Splendid hears voices behind him, unsure if they're familiar but they are approaching, and this is a path the guards have been taking. 
### 
### -------
### 
### Figure starts to open the door, while Splendid is trying to stay unseen. 
### 
### -------
### 
### As the figure goes to leave, they spot Splendid. Welp. "Good evening. Looking for something?" 
### 
### Figure takes off running the other direction immediately.
### 
### -------
### 
### Unfortunately, the figure gets away. The guards tell him that the house is the abandoned dwelling of the recent mayor that got run out of town. 
### 
### -------
### 
### The figure was using Umbrian equipment, turns out. We're wondering if the mayor was involved with the Umbrians.
### 
### -------
### 
### IT'S MORNING.
### 
### Breakfast first, THEN interrogation.
### 
### -------
### 
### Belle: "I CAST ZONE OF TRUTH." [#]taz
### 
### -------
### 
### Belle also casts Suggestion that he cooperate fully w/ us,  he failed his save for both ZoT & Suggestion. 
### 
### Kyrial holds up sword/knife from hobgoblin captain we killed in previous episode, says, through Belle, "I know exactly what this is and how to use it." 
### 
### -------
### 
### The hobgoblin tells Belle "Your world will burn."
### 
### Belle replies: "My world is iron and stone, pitiful being. You know nothing of my world."
### 
### -------
### 
### Belle, to the hobgoblin: "As someone of a people who used to live here, the humans are more resilient than you will ever give them credit for, to your detriment and ruin."
### 
### -------
### 
### Belle sings a threatening Umbrian lullaby she knows to assist Kyrial in being even more intimidating. Hobgoblin is wetting his pants. He is a-scared. 
### 
### -------
### 
### What we discovered is that the hobgoblins' city got flooded, and so the hobgoblins are moving into new territory. That territory is already occupied, but they don't care.
### 
### -------
### 
### They are using the goblins for protection, and exploiting them, as we know, but now we've heard it for sure.
### 
### This guy's master's name translates to dragon something. He's working with an Umbrian leader in the south.
### 
### -------
### 
### Belle has decided to study Umbrian with Kyrial. Next time, we'll probably return to Argento to investigate further the hobgoblin situation and maybe do something about it.
### 
### -------
### 
### Next episode, we will work on liberating the goblins! That's all for now. Belledora Ironmaul, signing off!
