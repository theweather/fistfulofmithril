### Iiiiit's time for the next installation of [#]fistfulofmithril! I'm Belledora Ironmaul, Dwarven Battle Bard and Archivist!
### 
### -------
### 
### Malio's goblin people have rebuilt much of Western Argento, and we are here to meet with them.
### 
### -------
### 
### Kerrig, Skaria, Filoh, & Gizbit look expectantly at Belle. Belle explains that they are here to make good on the promise to help oust the hobgoblins, and to restore Kyrial's lands. Kyrial wants to do this together, not by kicking the goblins out. 
### 
### -------
### 
### The goblins were mining the hills nearby. Malio's crechemother, Dritz, was the leader when the hobgoblin leader Koth and his master Azarr Kul turned their attention to them. Thus we find ourselves where we are today, goblins enslaved and subjugated.
### 
### -------
### 
### Dritz is kept alive to control the goblin population, to keep them in line. The hobgoblins have only started flooding into the town in the last couple of months due to some event in the mountains that drove them down here. 
### 
### -------
### 
### Gizbit is a hill goblin, whose people live further up the mountains and have co-existed with the hobgoblins for centuries. Strange weather events are occurring in the mountains, and goblin and hobgoblin alike have moved to the lowlands.
### 
### -------
### 
### Filo mentions that the party is lucky that it was they and not others more inclined to turn us in. "If they had been other than your perspective, we would not have given them a chance to report back, I'm afraid. We are not unaware of  what's at stake here."
### 
### -------
### 
### Filo mentions that there are 100 or so hobgoblins and some additional allies. There are more than a few manticores, and various bugbear and ogre allies further in the mountains, and a few hill giants.
### 
### -------
### 
### "It was like that one time in Waterdeep, eh, Gordon? Though what a hill giant was doing in Waterdeep, I still haven't the faintest idea about what a hill giant was doing in Waterdeep." 
### 
### -------
### 
### The hobgoblins regularly patrol within a day's travel of Argento, with scouts that go 2-3 days' travel out sometimes. 20-30 miles around the town is pretty well patrolled.
### 
### -------
### 
### We recalled there is a stone circle we visited last time we were here, and thought it might be a good place for a dead-drop. Kyrial and Belle work together to make a simple cipher using the dwarven alphabet, and Filo learns it. 
### 
### -------
### 
### Filo will speak with goblins to find out who might be up for an uprising, and he will leave messages at the stone circle. The party is going to head out to camp because the hobgoblins come in along the road near where we are.
### 
### -------
### 
### EXCEPT A BIG PARTY OF BADDIES IS COMING.
### 
### to the tune of Frere Jacques:
### "we should leave now
### we should leave now
### company
### company
### they have a hill giant
### they have a hill giant
### run away
### run away"
### 
### They also have BUGBEARS and HOBGOBLINS and MANY OTHER THINGS. D:
### 
### -------
### 
### Apparently we're hiding instead.
### 
### -------
### 
### Gizbit tells Splendid that she recognizes the wand he took off Salvatore, and she also tells him that that same human man had come to parley with Koth some months earlier.
### 
### -------
### 
### ...and on this round of Stealth checks, Belle rolls a natural 1.
### She sneezes. Operatically.
### 
### D: D: D: 
### 
### -------
### 
### AND WE FAIL MORE STEALTH ROLLS
### 
### Belle casts Plant Growth to hinder the baddies, and excludes the party's location and route. Ttto "Row Row Row Your Boat" 
### 
### Grow, grow, grow the leaves,
### grow them big and strong,
### Block the way & save the day
### So we can move along
### 
### -------
### 
### Splendid casts Illusion and makes a Treant (the X) appear to be behind the baddies. Gizbit casts Lightning Bolt and hits A WHOLE BUNCHA BADDIES.

### 
### -------
### 
### Hill Giant saves, but a couple baddies die. 
### 
### Gizbit gets away! We RUN, but the hobgoblins shoot at all non-rogues.

### 
### -------
### 
### Gordon, Kerrig, Belle, and Gizbit get shot, but they're all alive and running.
### 
### Kyrial: "Well, THAT happened."
### 
### Belle: "Sometimes, shit happens."
### 
### *sings* "Shit can happen to you, shit can happen to me"
### 
### -------
### 
### Gizbit and the other goblins choose to return to town, Gizbit first donning an illusion so they can't find her.
### 
### The party leaves town.
### 
### -------
### 
### Kyrial somehow sets herself on fire while trying to pitch a tent. (She rolled two natural ones.)
### 
### Following two images:
### Rolls:
### Jane: cleric 12
### Gordon: barbarian 7
### Knell: rogue 8 (nat 1)
### Kyrial: rogue nat 1 x2
### Vivian: sorceress 9
### Belle: bard 13
### Kyrial: "I am SUCH a city girl."

### 
### We camp & that's a wrap for today, because we went absolutely not where the DM expected & he doesn't have the next map prepared! Sorry, DM! Thanks for your patience. <3

### This is Belledora Ironmaul, dwarven battle bard and Archivist, signing off until next time.
