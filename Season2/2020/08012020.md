### Once again we find ourselves with our party in [#]fistfulofmithril ! I'm Belledora Ironmaul, Dwarven Battle Bard and Party Archivist!
### 
### -------
### 
### 1200 pounds of gold in four chests; only Gordon can carry a chest by himself, though Knell's not far behind.
### 
### -------
### 
### We absolutely cannot carry all of this, Kyrial's family fortune, so we're figuring out where we can get another horse and cart.
### 
### -------
### 
### The archivist got distracted! Oops!
### 
### So. Malio's the son of the matriarch of his clan who is being held hostage by the hobgoblins that have been moving down from the mountains. Malio & his people used to live in the woods, but after the human war, a Blight came.
### 
### -------
### 
### We're going to try to get to Fandalino through the forest to the road to avoid goblin and hobgoblin patrols, but will not hesitate to capture and interrogate a hobgoblin.
### 
### -------
### 
### We're carrying the gold from one chest and hiding the rest, and taking a long rest to regain all the things.
### 
### -------
### 
### Morning dawns warmer than the previous day, and spring continues to advance, even here in the mountains. We're rested and fed and ready for our travels.
### 
### -------
### 
### It's rather dark in the forest. Knell notices that there are no humanoid tracks past a point. There are some very large animal tracks, including direwolf. There are also some VERY strange, very LARGE, totally unfamiliar nonhumanoid tracks.
### 
### -------
### 
### Belle was writing a song and rolled a 1, so noticed nothing whatsoever. This is on brand and they're teasing her about it.
### 
### -------
### 
### There are...concerning plumes of black smoke rising from Argento, looking like evidence of a rapid growth in industry. This is...concerning.
### 
### -------
### 
### We have four rogues. We're scouting. 
### 
### TWIG BLIGHT.
### 
### -------
### 
### 3 people rolled 13 on initiative. The Unfortune 8 have a 13 Crew! 
### 
### -------
### 
### A vine caught Malio, and Belle SMASHES the twig blight coming toward him with Feather!
### 
### -------
### 
### Jane casts Sacred Flame and damages the next Twig Blight!
### Gordon chops the vine and frees Malio!
### 
### -------
### 
### Knell is spotting...several...unusually moving plants now. Oh dear. Beleaf it or not, this is happening.
### 
### -------
### 
### We've got VINE BLIGHTS. Their bite is worse than their bark.
### 
### -------
### 
### We'll stick it to it!
### 
### -------
### 
### Splendid: "You call yourself a PLANT."
### Vine Blight:  ;_; 
### 
### -------
### 
### We're fighting MANY plants. Smashy stabby singey shattery. A vine is a delightful thing to waste.
### 
### -------
### 
### All-Purpose Cleavers is my new bandname.
### 
### -------
### 
### BEEG TREE. 
### 
### TREANT.
### 
### BEEG.
### 
### -------
### 
### We've FINALLY reached "Splendid, how do you want to do this?" on the dang Treant.
### 
### With fire. Lots and lots of fire. Well done, Splendid.
### 
### -------
### 
### We finished the battle, and Malio has left us to go to his people. Belle sends him with an Ironmaul crest mithril bar, and Kyrial send him with a locket with her family crest, telling him that he is also her people if she regains the land.
### 
### -------
### 
### Malio thanked Gordon, and Belle in particular, for showing him that not all non-goblins are bad. Bye Malio! Good luck with your resistance against the Hobgoblins. Contact us if you need help! 
### 
### -------
### 
### We have entered the town, and Kyrial's lead is what we'll follow for this. Thus ends this installment of Fistful of Mithril. This is Belledora Ironmaul, Dwarven Battle Bard and Archivist, signing off until next time.
