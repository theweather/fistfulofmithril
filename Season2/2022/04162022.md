### It's once again time for [#]fistfulofmithril! I'm Belledora Ironmaul, Dwarven Battle Bard, Ironmaul Heir, and party archivist! Get ready for shenanigans!
### 
### -------
### 
### TORCH: WELCOME TO THE TORCHY SHOW, WHERE WE TELL ALL THE HOT NEWS!
### 
### [#]torchyroasts
### 
### -------
### 
### Please pardon our overly-enthusiastic lightsource, they're very hot-headed.
### 
### [#]torchyno
### 
### -------
### 
### We're currently still incarcerated in the Circle of Bureaucracy druid village. This is going well. >.>
### 
### -------
### 
### Uccello was unable to convince the council of the worth of assisting us, and now we're stuck in this treehouse. Housetree. We can't embark while we're embarked.
### 
### -------
### 
### There appears to be no locks on our side of the door. We elect to take a long rest, and Belle and Bree take first watch, Splendid and Kyrial for second, Vivian and Knell for third. Jane was injured, so she's sleeping the night. 
### 
### -------
### 
### Belle gives Bree Bardic Inspiration, and Bree gets a total of 21 on her Perception check. "You better watch out, you better not cry, you better not pout, I'm tellin' you why, 'cause some shit's gonna take us outta towwnnnnn"
### 
### -------
### 
### About 90 minutes into our watch, Bree hears, and relays to Belle, that she hears Cyril talking to Darien about the strange council decision about us. They're hoping they'll at least be able to learn more about why this is happening. 
### 
### -------
### 
### Cyril tells Darien that he desperately wants to get his claws into that damn basilisk, and Darien says he'll be there to help. 5-10 minutes later, Bree hears shuffling and animal noises outside. It's Rowan's animal companion, a big bear named Mishka.
### 
### -------
### 
### Belle sings a quiet little song about good boy bears, and Mishka hears it. 
### 
### As we swap out watches, Belle bardicly inspires both Splendid and Kyrial, and curls up to go to sleep.
### 
### Kyrial hears a sound outside. 
### 
### -------
### 
### Two other council people, Wilva and someone else, also discussing the situation. The Council voted to exile us, 3 to 2, with 1 abstention (Dania). Kyrial wakes Bree up and tells her what she heard. 
### 
### -------
### 
### Splendid is attempting to use Eldritch Sight to see the lock so he can try picking it with his Mage Hand. It doesn't work too well.
### 
### -------
### 
### Nester and Armand Wildrose have stealthily arrived and unlocked the door! We're...not all good at stealth, unfortunately, so we'll see how this goes!
### 
### -------
### 
### Unfortunately, Rowan and Laralyn (heads of council) catch us, and another council member arrives with soldiers. Bree entangles the newcomers. Belle casts Zone of Truth on Rowan and Laralyn, tries to convince them to tell her why they want the basilisk to live.
### 
### -------
### 
### Cyril and Darren fly down in bird-of-prey form and shape-change, and tell Rowan "Don't let this go any further."
### 
### Rowan gives in, tells them he will have no part in it and that the Grand Druid will hear of this, and we have collectively diffused the situation.
### 
### -------
### 
### We board some boats and arrive at some red tile and brick ruins rising from a bend in the river. Jane senses great death, old death, around a century old, and advises us to proceed respectfully. So many petrified people from all over, and various species.
### 
### -------
### 
### We're trying to locate the basilisk before it can locate us. Bree is blessing each statue that was someone she knew. Jane's following our frontrunners at a distance. Belle's bringing up the rear. Some of the others are in the vicinity and looking around.
### 
### -------
### 
### We apply the rockfish oil, and Kyrial brings up the communication spell. 
### 
### Kyrial: "I don't plan to get close to the thing."
### 
### Belle: "Yes, well, best laid plans and giant snakes..."
### 
### Kyrial: "I mean, fair."
### 
### (Torch: I AM THE ALL-SEEING TORCHY.)
### 
### -------
### 
### There are bits of stone all over the place, bits of previously petrified people. It really puts the grave in gravel.
### 
### Whilst Belle is distracted by a bird, Vivian thinks she sees one of the statues move...
### 
### -------
### 
### Armand slaps one of the statues, and nothing happens at first...
### 
### ...until the statue attacks him.
### 
### AND THAT'S where we leave it for today! I'm Belledora Ironmaul, Dwarven Battle Bard, Ironmaul Heir, and Party Archivist, signing off until next time!
